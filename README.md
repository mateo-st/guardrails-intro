# Exploring AI Guardrails

This repository documents introductory learning on **guardrails for generative AI applications**. mainly following the [Safe and Reliable AI via Guardrails](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/safe-and-reliable-ai-via-guardrails/) short course provided by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). Here, you’ll find notes, code examples, and (eventually) small experiments related to safe and reliable AI practices.

## Contents

- 📝 Course notes
- 💻 Code examples
- 🧪 Experiments

## Installation

### Dependencies
